{"Name":"Image File Execution Options","KeyPath":"Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Image File Execution Options","ShortDescription":"Force a program to run via debugger","LongDescription":"Its intended use is to force a program to run under a debugger regardless of how it is launched (and secondarily to alter how the system treats the program). It's handy if you need to debug a program \"in the wild\" rather than under the controlled environment of your favorite IDE. For example, you can use it if you want to debug how a program runs when it is launched by some other program you can't debug.","InternalID":"59ddbb92-609a-44e8-9bb7-e1f5b797e397","HiveType":"Software","Category":"Operating system"}
